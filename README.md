# PlatformerMini (Monolith codename) - uwp branch

## About 
This is my experiment to run Monogame+MonolithEngine UWP app on/in W10M Astoria :) This is my "UWP fork" of some interesting (but archived) small & lightweight 2D video game engine named MonolithEngine.

## Tech details
- Target: Windows UWP (some mobile ui elements present for "touch ui").
- Monolith Engine tweaked (it incapsulated into Engine folder).
- Game tweaked a little too (it incapsulated into Game folder because of monolith structure)))

## Features / My experimentation(s)
- Min. Win. OS Build descreased to 10240 (Astoria Compatibility)
- Not tweaked Monogame 3.8 library (resuces project suze, but so many UI stranges)
- On Lumia 950, app starts; On Lumia 640 it no operable without PC connected/debug mode :( On Lumia 640 "Astoria" project deployable but app no operable (failed on start).

## Requirements
This app requires Visual Studio 2017/2019/2022 Community to run. [Click here to learn how to get set up with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/get-set-up).
